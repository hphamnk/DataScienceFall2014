        <p>cs378 Data Science ggplot2/Shiny Project</p>
    <ol>
          <li>Find a large data set that's interesting to you. It should consist of  several tables (or equivalent data structure) one of which is &gt;= 100K  rows. This should be your main data table. The other tables should have  appropriate relationships (foreign keys) to the main data table. E.g.,  the diamonds data.frame in the ggplot2 package would be a data table  (but it's too small - only 50k rows). There might be other tables like  customer (who bought the diamond), manufacturer (who cut the diamond)  and the retailer (who sold the diamond).</li>
          <li>Create a Logical Model for the data (I suggest using SQLDeveloper Data Modeler to draw the model).</li>
          <li>Load the data into your Oracle account.</li>
          <li>Create a RStudio Project for your work with files managed in GiTHub.</li>
          <li>Where appropriate, follow the guidelines in the&quot;Reproducible Research with R and RStudio&quot; book to produce a reproducible Project. Your data will be in a database so you probably won't need all of their file structures but you should  have a knitr document for your Project and whatever else is appropriate (see my <a href="https://github.com/pcannata/DataScienceFall2014/tree/master/RProject">RProject</a> for an example).</li>
          <li>Use the ggplots described in the  RWorkshop (and in the "R for Everyone" book) and at least one ggplot (or other piece of R technology like maps) that's not described in these resources (i.e., one that you have discovered on your own that you have found useful) to discover some interesting aspects of your data.</li>
          <li>Build an html file that documents the steps to reproduce your project using Knitr. Use this html file to present a visual story about your data and what you discovered about your data using visualization techniques.</li>
          <li>Present a (possibly simpler) interactive visual story  about the data on your localhost shiny server.</li>
    </ol>
