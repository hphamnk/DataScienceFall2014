        <p>cs378 Data Science Data Mining Project</p>
    <p>Convince me that you have found something very interesting in your data or demonstrate a valiant attempt.</p>
    <p>This is a difficult project and grading will be harder than previous projects. I strongly recommend going through Lessons 7, 8, and 9 in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~cannata/dataSci/Class%20Notes/ODM%20Activity%20Guide.pdf" data-mce-href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~cannata/dataSci/Class%20Notes/ODM%20Activity%20Guide.pdf">Oracle Data Mining Activity Guide</a>&nbsp;the way we did with Lessons 5, and 6 in class on Oct. 30th. This should only take an hour or two. Then, start applying all of the techniques learned in Lessons 5 - 9 to your data sets along with doing appropriate visualizations in Tableau.&nbsp;<strong>This should be done sooner than later - just a warning.</strong>    </p>
    <div id="questionText">
      <p>A Professional Quality Project Presentation is part of convincing me that you have found something very interesting in your data. The elements of such a presentation should be to tell me</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the data you analyzed</li>
        <li>what you found that's very interesting</li>
        <li>how the&nbsp;<strong>data</strong>&nbsp;supports what you found</li>
        <li>the&nbsp;technology you used in your findings via a short, well thought-out demo</li>
        <li>what additional follow-up investigations could be done      </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This should be done in a simple, concise, straight-forward manner&nbsp;<strong><em>in the time&nbsp;allotted</em></strong>&nbsp;either using power point or a KnitR doc (which &nbsp;will be required for the final GiThub-based&nbsp;project submission). It would be wise to rehearse your presentation several times before your scheduled presentation time.    </p>
